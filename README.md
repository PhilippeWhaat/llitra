LLITRA stands for Legal Language Identification Test for Restricting Access

LLITRA is a project aimed at solving the problem of putting unstructured data in a format that can be reused for analysis in the legal world. The goal of the project is to transform unstructured data into structured data, which is a challenging task through linguistics. As authors follow their unique styles, not all ideas are written in the same way, making it difficult for machines to extract data elements from a document.

To overcome this challenge, the semantic layer, which comprehends the relationship between data elements and their values and surroundings, must also be trained by machines to suggest an output in a specific format. Historically, this task was only performed manually by humans, but the project is proposing a hybrid scheme between humans and machines to facilitate machine learning.

The main problem with legal data is the lack of structure, making it difficult to use and utilize. This is because a machine that processes data cannot understand context or a string of words and identify it to apply its meaning to a specific case. Advanced legal analysis through technology is only possible if based on accurate and exact information.

To feed an algorithm with legal texts, the contents of legal text must be divided and indicated to the machine for processing. The most efficient way to obtain this confirmation is through a legal CAPTCHA. A CAPTCHA is a challenge-response test used to determine if the user is human or not. The results are stored in a database, allowing the machine to compare its findings with human interpretations and improve its learning algorithm.

The LLITRA project hypothesizes that it is technically viable to identify complex legal concepts through automatic language analysis, trained through standard legal knowledge using a CAPTCHA.
